# Interactive Expert System for Personalized Learning Pathways

## Project Overview

This project is designed as an interactive expert system that provides personalized learning recommendations based on user responses to a series of questions. The system is tailored for beginner-level AI practices and is aimed at helping users create a learning pathway suited to their needs and preferences. Whether you are a novice in programming or looking to expand your skills in a specific domain, this expert system will suggest the best learning resources and strategies to fit your goals.

## Features

- **Dynamic Questioning:** The system asks users a series of questions about their learning goals, experience, time availability, and preferences.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Based on user responses, the system generates customized recommendations for learning resources, such as online courses, platforms, and practical projects.
- **Support for Multiple Domains:** Recommendations span across several fields, including web development, machine learning, cybersecurity, and more.
- **Interactive Interface:** The interface uses Tkinter to provide an engaging, user-friendly experience.
- **Simple AI Practices:** This project focuses on beginner-level AI concepts such as rule-based decision-making, data handling, and dynamic content rendering.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)
- Basic understanding of Python and AI concepts

## How It Works

1. **User Input:** The system prompts the user with a series of questions regarding their goals, preferences, available time, and prior experience.
2. **Dynamic Questioning:** Based on user responses, the system adapts and continues to ask relevant questions.
3. **Recommendation Generation:** Once all questions are answered, the system generates a detailed recommendation, which may include suggestions for online courses, books, projects, and more.
4. **Clickable Links:** Recommendations come with clickable links to useful resources such as courses on Udemy, Coursera, and other platforms.

## Key Features in Detail

- **User-Friendly Interface:** A simple and clean Tkinter interface ensures easy interaction with the system.
- **Flexible Question Flow:** The questions are designed to adapt based on the user's previous answers, allowing for a dynamic conversation.
- **Comprehensive Recommendations:** Each recommendation is detailed, with actionable steps and resources for different fields.
- **Support for Multiple Learning Preferences:** Whether you prefer theoretical, practical, or mixed learning, the system customizes recommendations based on your input.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Application:** Simply run the Python script to launch the system.
2. **Answer the Questions:** Respond to each question by either selecting from options or entering text where applicable.
3. **Receive Recommendations:** Once all questions are answered, the system will display a personalized learning pathway with links to valuable resources.
4. **Click the "Enter" Key or the "Next" Button:** You can either press the "Enter" key or click the "Next" button to move to the next question.

## Example Questions

- What is your level in programming? (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- What is your learning goal? (Web, Machine Learning, Cybersecurity, etc.)
- How many hours per week can you dedicate to learning?
- Do you prefer theoretical, practical, or mixed learning?

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **Tkinter**: Used for creating the graphical user interface.
- **AI Concepts**: Simple rule-based decision-making for personalized recommendations.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expand the Question Set:** Add more questions to cover additional aspects of learning and preferences.
- **Advanced AI Models:** Implement more sophisticated recommendation algorithms such as machine learning models.
- **Integration with Online Platforms:** Automatically fetch course data from platforms like Udemy, Coursera, etc.
- **Multi-Language Support:** Add multi-language options for international users.
